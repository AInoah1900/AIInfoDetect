## summary

- task number: 4
- sample number: 10
- involved models: ['deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2.5', 'Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct', 'Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct', 'Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct', 'Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct']
- model provider: siliconflow api

## conclusion

Overall, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct and DeepSeek-V2.5 perform significantly better than other evaluated models.

Comparatively, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct tends to prioritize extraction accuracy, which may result in information omission; while DeepSeek-V2.5 tends to extract as much information as possible (while maintaining certain precision), which may lead to information redundancy.

Two interesting points:

- Due to its smaller parameter size, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct cannot understand the focus requirements well. It tends to extract all available information, but can still maintain stable output format as required by the prompt (comparatively, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct often fails to follow the instructed output format, and even Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct tends to deviate from the instructed format). Therefore, if you don't mind mixing in excessive irrelevant information, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct could be a cost-effective choice;

- DeepSeek-V2.5 performs remarkably well in focus information extraction and relevant link selection, but performs poorly in author and publish date extraction, even worse than Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. The latter, while performing worse than Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct in information extraction tasks, excels at author and publish date extraction, so I would recommend using it as a secondary model.

- Scores represent the number of times the output deviated from human expectations, including omissions, extraction errors, and hallucinations, so lower scores are better.
- Cost unit is Ôø•, all evaluations use siliconflow api, according to siliconflow official pricing.
