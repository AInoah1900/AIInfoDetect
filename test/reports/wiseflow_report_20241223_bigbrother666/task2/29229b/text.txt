 Rules


















1



            Be civil and follow Reddiquette (read full)






















    Whether you’re just starting out or have years of experience- we want this to be a welcoming and inclusive community.
  

    No hate speech/rhetoric, discrimination, bigotry, or prejudices. Be respectful.
  

    Don't start or end conversations being rude to users. No harassing. No provoking, ‘gotchas’, or other bad faith behaviors or discourse.
  

    If it looks like you’re rabble-rousing, baiting, or trolling, especially if you have no other or limited history here we will use our discretion.
  
























2



            Self-advertisement (read full)























Click here for the full rule, it is also located in the Wiki[url42]



    Your first post or comment cannot have promo, that would be 100% self-promo, do not try to get around the rule, it's 10%.
  

    Any questions or confusion you need to Modmail us first before posting.
  

    This sub is prone to scams, spam, and excessive promo. We want participation here first for you to advertise.
  

    No self-inserting your product here. We will use mod discretion.
  
























3



            No spam or off-topic posts






















    Please talk about AI or AI related topics like robotics, human enhancement, etc.
  

    Do not use clickbait, generic, sensationalized, one word, misleading, or link addresses in titles, etc. Describe what your post is about. Use concise, accurate titles.
  
























4



            No selling






















    No selling your own products or anything in general. It's sketchy and hard to enforce. This also includes crypto, job offers, and other unverifiable content of the like.
  
























5



            Too low-effort content






















    Low effort posts can be very subjective. As long as it's somewhat interesting, or engages discussion. We use mod discretion.
  

    This also applies to memes or humor, such as if it goes against other rules or Reddiquette.
  

    If it's at zero or few upvotes after a while, it may also be removed.
  

    This is not a politics-free zone. AI, politics, and news often intertwine. But follow Rule 1.
  
























6



            NSFW content






















    Discussion or news about how it relates to AI is fine, just no erotic content, graphic violence, etc.
  
























7



            AutoMod






















    If you're about to Modmail us about your post being removed when you feel you've followed the other rules, it's most likely because of 
AutoMod[url43]
. Basically it helps combat spammers, spambots, scammers, and trolls- this sub is excessively prone to those.
  

    Do not come to Modmail complaining to us or we won't reply or approve. This will let us know who reads the rules or not. Also, link your post in the Modmail for review. Thanks.
